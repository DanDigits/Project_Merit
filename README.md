## Introduction

Project Merit is a quick and easy tool where Air Force personnel can write, edit, and save performance reports from any device.

This tool will guide them to write evaluation reports according to the guidelines and standards set out by the Air Force.

Personnel will be able to export and download the reports for submission through official Air Force channels.
